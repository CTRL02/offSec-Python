So a basic tcp server that can handle requests and send an Ack/response to the client ex:(a email server and a user requesting a certain email)...



The IP address you provide for your TCP server depends on the context and purpose of your server. Here are a few scenarios and the types of IP addresses you might use:

Localhost (Loopback): If you want your TCP server to run on the same machine (localhost), you can use the loopback IP address 127.0.0.1. This is commonly used for testing and development on a single machine without involving a network.

Specific Local IP: If you want your TCP server to be accessible only within your local network, you would use an IP address assigned to your machine within the local network. For example, if your machine has an IP address of 192.168.1.100 on your local network, you can use that IP to bind your server.

Public IP: If you want your TCP server to be accessible from the internet, you would use your public IP address. This is the IP address that your router uses to communicate with the outside world. Note that this might involve setting up port forwarding on your router to direct incoming connections to your server's local IP.

Any Interface: You can also bind your TCP server to listen on all available network interfaces by using the IP address 0.0.0.0 This means the server will listen on all network interfaces, making it accessible from both localhost and external connections.
